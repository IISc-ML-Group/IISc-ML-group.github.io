  image: Pub_BCl.png
  description: Alzheimers disease (AD) currently affects about 5.3 million individuals in United States and more than 30 million worldwide with a significant increase predicted in the near future. Identifying markers that can affect the disease using machine learning techniques is important for timely treatment.

- title: "Overlapping Community Detection"
  image: rishab_project.png
  description: Networks are ubiquitous in nature and they generally tend to have community structure in them. For example, in social networks, we form communities within ourselves and tend to be connected with more people who belong to our community. In real-world networks, these communities are found to be overlapping, i.e. each node can belong to several communities. E.g. in a social network, we connect with our family, friends and colleagues, all belonging to different communities. Detecting such overlapping communities with provable error bounds and scalability to massive networks is the primary goal of this project.

- title: "Program Synthesis meets Machine Learning"
  image: ps.png
  description:  Program synthesis has its roots in formal methods and programming languages. The goal of program synthesis is to automatically generate a program (from a space of possible programs) which satisfies a specification written in logic. The problem has its roots in a paper by Church in 1957, and the initial breakthroughs were made by Buchi and Landweber (1969) and M O Rabin (1972), who showed that the synthesis problem is decidable for specifications written in certain logics. However, the complexity of the algorithms was too high (non-elementary to exptime) to be useful in practice. Recently there is an interesting interplay developing between program synthesis and machine learning. Machine learning uses continuous optimization methods to learn models that minimize a specified loss function, whereas program synthesis uses discrete combinatorial search to learn programs that satisfy a specification. While program synthesis produces interpretable programs, which can be formally verified, machine learning deals with noise in the inputs more gracefully. There is a rich body of recent work in combining machine learning and program synthesis to get the benefits of both approaches.

- title: "SLAM on LiDAR based autonomous vehicles"
  image: ati_mule.png
  description: Has the concept the Autonomous vehicles already transformed from fiction to reality? Has the development in this avenue reached the plateau? Not yet, Level 5 autonomy is not even in the picture. The pinnacle will be reached when the AV will have the capability to sense and perceive the environment with human accuracy. Simultaneous localization and mapping(SLAM) is a major component. Developing SLAM is the task of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it. Currently, our team in collaboration with Ati motors is working on SLAM, occlusion handling.

- title: "Teaching assistance through social robotics for children with autism"
  image: SR.png
  description: In this project, we sought to develop technological assistance for improving communication in autistic children using social robotics. Using a robot, we have built conversational AI-based solutions and  demonstrated a proof of concept  (POC) at ASHA, a leading special needs school. The POC mainly focused on improving communication challenges faced by ASD children. At the end of seven sessions with six children, there was a reduction in the prompts needed by all the children to perform tasks and the accuracy of answers also increased. Two of the children performed tasks in English  (which was not their language of choice and not used by special educators in their classrooms). One child had an improvement in sentence construction while interacting with the robot and another child showed improved motivation to write and recall spellings due to the robotâ€™s feedback.
