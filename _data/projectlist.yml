  description: Alzheimers disease (AD) currently affects about 5.3 million individuals in United States and more than 30 million worldwide with a significant increase predicted in the near future. Identifying markers that can affect the disease using machine learning techniques is important for timely treatment.

- title: "Overlapping Community Detection"
  image: rishab_project.png
  description: Networks are ubiquitous in nature and they generally tend to have community structure in them. For example, in social networks, we form communities within ourselves and tend to be connected with more people who belong to our community. In real-world networks, these communities are found to be overlapping, i.e. each node can belong to several communities. E.g. in a social network, we connect with our family, friends and colleagues, all belonging to different communities. Detecting such overlapping communities with provable error bounds and scalability to massive networks is the primary goal of this project.

- title: "Program Synthesis using Machine Learning"
  image: rishab_project.png
  description:  Program synthesis has its roots in formal methods and programming languages. The goal of program synthesis is to automatically generate a program (from a space of possible programs) which satisfies a specification written in logic. The problem has its roots in a paper by Church in 1957, and the initial breakthroughs were made by Buchi and Landweber (1969) and M O Rabin (1972), who showed that the synthesis problem is decidable for specifications written in certain logics. However, the complexity of the algorithms was too high (non-elementary to exptime) to be useful in practice.

Recent formulations have made synthesis more practical. In his PhD thesis, Solar-Lezama formulated synthesis as "sketching" , a process where part of the program is given by the user as a template and the synthesizer merely fills in "holes" in the sketch using search. Another recent formulation, due to Sumit Gulwani uses input/output examples (rather than formulas) as specifications , and uses clever search algorithms to generate appropriate programs. Sparked by these two works, there has been a resurgence or work in program synthesis in the past decade. There is an annual Sygus competition where practical tools compete every year.

Recently there is an interesting interplay developing between program synthesis and machine learning. Machine learning uses continuous optimization methods to learn models that minimize a specified loss function, whereas program synthesis uses discrete combinatorial search to learn programs that satisfy a specification. While program synthesis produces interpretable programs, which can be formally verified, machine learning deals with noise in the inputs more gracefully. There is a rich body of recent work in combining machine learning and program synthesis to get the benefits of both approaches.
