- title: "Overlapping Community Detection"
  image: rishab_project.png
  description: Networks are ubiquitous in nature and they generally tend to have community structure in them. For example, in social networks, we form communities within ourselves and tend to be connected with more people who belong to our community. In real-world networks, these communities are found to be overlapping, i.e. each node can belong to several communities. E.g. in a social network, we connect with our family, friends and colleagues, all belonging to different communities. Detecting such overlapping communities with provable error bounds and scalability to massive networks is the primary goal of this project.
