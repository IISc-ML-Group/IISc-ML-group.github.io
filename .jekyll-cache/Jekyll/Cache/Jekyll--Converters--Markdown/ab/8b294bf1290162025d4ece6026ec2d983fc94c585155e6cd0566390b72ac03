      <p>Alzheimers disease (AD) currently affects about 5.3 million individuals in United States and more than 30 million worldwide with a significant increase predicted in the near future. Identifying markers that can affect the disease using machine learning techniques is important for timely treatment.</p>

      <p>Networks are ubiquitous in nature and they generally tend to have community structure in them. For example, in social networks, we form communities within ourselves and tend to be connected with more people who belong to our community. In real-world networks, these communities are found to be overlapping, i.e. each node can belong to several communities. E.g. in a social network, we connect with our family, friends and colleagues, all belonging to different communities. Detecting such overlapping communities with provable error bounds and scalability to massive networks is the primary goal of this project.</p>

      <pubtit>Program Synthesis meets Machine Learning</pubtit>

      <p>Program synthesis has its roots in formal methods and programming languages. The goal of program synthesis is to automatically generate a program (from a space of possible programs) which satisfies a specification written in logic. Recent developments shows incredible performance when Program Synthesis is combined with Machine Learning techniques. The Goal of this project is to study the various possible improvements in Program Synthesis from Logical Specification using Machine Learning models for syntheizing Skethches (Partial Programs) first and then performing Symbolic Search in order to get the final program.</p>

      <p>Has the concept the Autonomous vehicles already transformed from fiction to reality? Has the development in this avenue reached the plateau? Not yet, Level 5 autonomy is not even in the picture. The pinnacle will be reached when the AV will have the capability to sense and perceive the environment with human accuracy. Simultaneous localization and mapping(SLAM) is a major component. Developing SLAM is the task of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent’s location within it. Currently, our team in collaboration with Ati motors is working on SLAM, occlusion handling.</p>

      <pubtit>Teaching assistance through social robotics for children with autism</pubtit>
      <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/pubpic/SR.png" class="img-responsive" width="33%" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;" /></p>
      <p>In this project, we sought to develop technological assistance for improving communication in autistic children using social robotics. Using a robot, we have built conversational AI-based solutions and  demonstrated a proof of concept  (POC) at ASHA, a leading special needs school. The POC mainly focused on improving communication challenges faced by ASD children. At the end of seven sessions with six children, there was a reduction in the prompts needed by all the children to perform tasks and the accuracy of answers also increased. Two of the children performed tasks in English  (which was not their language of choice and not used by special educators in their classrooms). One child had an improvement in sentence construction while interacting with the robot and another child showed improved motivation to write and recall spellings due to the robot’s feedback.</p>
